# RaceSimulation

This repository contains a digital race simulation project implemented in C programming language. The project was created as part of the Learn C course on Codecademy.

## Project Overview

In this simulation, two race cars, Aiden and Ethan, compete in an exciting race. The program provides a realistic racing experience by calculating random lap times based on speed, acceleration, and nerves. The leading car is determined after each lap, introducing an element of unpredictability to the race.

## Key Features

- **Realistic Race Simulation:** Experience the thrill of a competitive race with randomly generated lap times.
- **Dynamic Leaderboard:** The leading race car changes based on calculated lap times, making each lap exciting and unpredictable.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Professionally designed welcome messages and race updates enhance the user experience.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Compile the `main.c` file using a C compiler.
3. Run the compiled program to initiate the race simulation.

## Credits

This project was completed within the Learn C course on Codecademy. Credits to Codecademy for providing the project idea and resources for learning.

## Get Involved

Contributions are welcome! If you have suggestions, enhancements, or bug fixes, please submit a pull request. Let's make this digital race simulation even more exciting together.
